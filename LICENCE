Images of Robin Hood and Sheriff's henchmen: Originally created by my sister Christine some years ago; vectorized by me; She allowed me to use it for the game, but I don't know the licence. I should ask her, I would be happy if it would be public domain, too.

Everything else (except the binaries): Own work, public domain.

The binaries contain the flute sample as well as ctrulib, sf2d, etc. Therefore the binaries are not in public domain.
