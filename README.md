I tried to create almost public domain sources.
However, the clarinet sample, some images and the Makefile are (probably) not public domain (see LICENCE file).
Note that the dependencies (ctrulib, sf2d, ...) are NOT in the public domain. Therefore, the binaries wouldn't be, either.


Changelog :
v0.1
	- Initial Release.
